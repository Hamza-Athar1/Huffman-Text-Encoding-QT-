# Huffman Compression and Decompression Tool

This project is a graphical application developed using **Qt** for compressing and decompressing text files using the **Huffman Encoding Algorithm**. It provides an intuitive interface to browse files, visualize compression progress, and save the output files with ease.

## Features
- **Huffman Compression**: Compresses text files efficiently, reducing file size while retaining all content.
- **Huffman Decompression**: Restores the original file from the compressed binary file.
- **Progress Bar**: Visual feedback for the compression and decompression processes.
- **Compression Ratio Calculation**: Displays the ratio between original and compressed file sizes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use buttons for browsing, compressing, and decompressing files.
- **File Saving**: Supports saving compressed files in `.bin` format and decompressed files in `.txt` format.

## How It Works
1. **Browse and Load File**: Select the text file you want to compress.
2. **Compress**: Generate the compressed binary file using the Huffman Encoding Algorithm.
3. **Decompress**: Restore the original text from a previously compressed file.

## Code Highlights
- **Huffman Tree Implementation**: Builds a priority queue-based Huffman tree for encoding.
- **Serialization**: Efficient storage of Huffman codes within the compressed file.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Frees the Huffman tree to prevent memory leaks.
- **Qt Widgets**: Utilizes Qt's rich UI components, including progress bars and file dialogs.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core programming language.
- **Qt Framework**: For GUI development.
- **Huffman Algorithm**: To perform efficient text compression.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/huffman-compression-tool.git
   cd huffman-compression-tool
   ```
2. Open the project in Qt Creator.
3. Build and run the application.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for compressing multiple files in one session.
- Provide a visualization of the Huffman tree.
- Enable support for other file formats.
